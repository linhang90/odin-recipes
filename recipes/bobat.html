        <h2>A cup of Boba milk tea is an excellent start to anyone's day!</h2>
        <p1>Every cup of boba milk tea had this signature condensed milk flavor that fused 
            perfectly with the concentrated black tea. A lot of stands also use whole milk, so if 
            you’re not a fan of condensed milk, whole milk will also give you an authentic taste 
            of Taiwanese Boba Milk Tea! This drink is a thirst-quencher with a great caffeine kick. 
            If you prefer your drinks to be less sweet, reduce the amount of brown sugar syrup or 
            condensed milk during assembly. Don’t have muscovado sugar? Swap it out for brown sugar!

            <li>3/4 cup tapioca flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Brown Sugar Syrup:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup dark muscovado sugar, or brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Black Tea:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>6 black tea bags</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Milk Mixture:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons half & half</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the boba pearls: Add the water and muscovado sugar to a medium pan 
                over medium-high heat. Cook until the sugar dissolves and the mixture 
                comes to a boil, 3–4 minutes. Add a bit of the tapioca flour and cook, 
                stirring constantly, until smooth. Add half of the remaining tapioca 
                flour and stir vigorously until a sticky dough forms. Turn off the heat 
                and add the remaining tapioca flour. Stir until the dough comes together 
                in a ball (not all of the flour will be incorporated at this stage). Let 
                cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a clean surface. Knead until all of the flour is 
                incorporated and the dough is smooth, adding more flour or water as needed 
                if the dough is too sticky or too dry.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 2 portions. Roll the dough into long, thin ropes about 
                ¼-inch (6.35 mm) thick, cutting in half crosswise if they get too long. Cut 
                the ropes into ¼-inch (6.35 mm) pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and place 
                in a bowl with a bit of tapioca flour. Dust the balls with the flour to prevent 
                them from sticking to each other.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Shake off any excess flour from the 
                tapioca pearls, then add to the boiling water. Stir to separate the pearls, then 
                reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for about 
                20 minutes, until cooked through.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the brown sugar syrup: Add the muscovado sugar and water to a 
                small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the sugar dissolves and the syrup 
                reduces slightly, 5–7 minutes. Pour the syrup into a large heatproof bowl.</li>
            <li>Once the pearls have cooked through, drain and rinse with cold water. Add the 
                pearls to the bowl with the brown sugar syrup and let sit for 30–60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make the black tea: In a medium pot over high heat, combine the water and tea 
                bags. Bring to a boil, then remove the pan from the heat and let the tea cool 
                to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Make the milk mixture: In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together 
                the half-and-half and sweetened condensed milk until combined.</li>
            <li>Assemble the boba milk tea: Add about ⅓ cup (80 ml) boba pearls and brown sugar 
                syrup to the bottom of each glass. Top with 1½ cups (225 grams) ice, then add 
                ½ cup (240 ml) black tea and 3 tablespoons of the milk mixture. Stir with a 
                wide-opening straw, then serve.</li>
        </ol>
