        <h2>Japan's take on the classic pancakes.</h2>
        <p1>They are fluffy, airy, delicate pancakes that probably look too fancy for a weekday 
            breakfast, but impossible to resist making on the weekend. These pillowy, soft pancakes 
            are a must-try. You can not miss the fizzy, bubbly sound from the Souffle pancakes when 
            you cut them open to enjoy!
        </p1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        </ul>
        <h3>For the toppings:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Tbsp confectioner sugar/powdered sugar</li>
            <li>Fresh berries</li>
            <li>Maple syrup</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients.You will also need a 12-inch non-stick frying pan 
                (large enough to cook 3 pancakes at the same time) with a lid.</li>
            <li>Separate the egg whites and egg yolks into two different bowls. Put the bowl 
                with the egg whites in the freezer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, add the milk and vanilla to the egg yolks and whisk until 
                thick and frothy. </li>
            <li>Sift the cake flour and baking powder into the bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk to combine thoroughly (do not overmix) and set aside.</li>
            <li>After 15 minutes, take out the bowl with the egg whites from the freezer. The 
                egg whites should be half frozen. Now, start beating the egg whites with a hand 
                mixer (you can also use a stand mixer or balloon whisk).</li>
            <li>When the egg whites turn frothy and pale white, gradually add in the sugar 
                (roughly one-third at a time). Continue to whip the egg whites.</li>
            <li>The egg whites will become glossy and firm. Stop beating when you lift up the hand 
                mixer and the egg whites <strong>stand straight up but the tip of the peak curls over 
                onto itself</strong>. This is called medium/firm peaks (not stiff peaks yet). </li>
            <li>Heat a large non-stick frying pan to 300ºF (150ºC) over the lowest heat. Brush with 
                cooking oil and lightly remove any visible oil with a paper towel (otherwise the 
                pancakes will have a spotty pattern). Keep the pan on low heat while you combine the 
                egg whites and egg yolk mixture in the next step.</li>
            <li>Take one-third of the egg whites and add to the egg yolk mixture. Whisk together 
                (don’t worry too much about breaking air bubbles at this point).</li>
            <li>Next, take half of the remaining egg whites and add to the egg yolk mixture. Using 
                a whisk, gently fold them in without breaking the air bubbles in the egg whites.</li>
            <li>Now, transfer the egg yolk mixture back into the remaining egg whites. Carefully fold 
                the two mixtures together without breaking any air bubbles. Make sure to mix the 
                batter very gently until the ingredients are thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Keep your frying pan heated to 300 ºF (150 ºC) at all times over low heat. Remember, 
                each pancake gets roughly 4 small scoops of batter, and you will be making three 
                pancakes. For the first pancake, place one scoop of batter and make a tall mound in 
                the frying pan, using a small ladle or a serving spoon (that’s bigger than a regular 
                spoon—probably 2-3 Tbsp). Next, stack one more scoop of batter onto the first scoop 
                already in the pan. Repeat for the next two pancakes, giving each pancake two scoops 
                of batter.</li>
            <li>By the time all three pancakes have two scoops, the surface of the batter is slightly 
                dry already. At this point, you can mound one more scoop on top of each pancake, 
                keeping the batter piled up high. In the bowl, you should still have roughly three 
                scoops left (if you have slightly more, that’s okay).</li>
            <li>Set the timer for 6-7 minutes, add 1 Tbsp water in three empty spaces inside the pan, 
                and cover with a lid. The steam from the water keeps the pancakes moist while they 
                cook. Please note: The suggested time is just a guideline; how long you will cook the 
                pancakes is based on the temperature of your frying pan.</li>
            <li>After 2 minutes have passed, open the lid, and add one final scoop for each pancake 
                (or more scoops if you have more batter). Make sure to stack the batter high, not wide. 
                If the water has evaporated, add a little bit more. Cover with the lid and cook.</li>
            <li>After 6-7 minutes have passed, lift the pancake VERY GENTLY using an offset spatula. 
                If the pancake is stuck, don’t touch it until it firms up a little. If you force it, 
                the pancake will crack in the middle. When the pancake is ready, you can easily move 
                the pancake.</li>
            <li>Slightly pull the pancake to create an empty space and gently flip it over with a 
                “rolling over” motion.</li>
            <li>Add more water to the empty spaces in the pan and set the timer for 4-5 minutes to 
                cook the other side on the lowest heat setting.</li>
            <li>Once they are nicely browned, transfer the pancakes to your serving plates.</li>
            <li>Place the fresh whipped cream on the pancakes and top with the berries. Dust the 
                pancake with confectioners’ sugar and drizzle with maple syrup. Enjoy!</li>
